# Bootstrap_Responsive_Portfolio
Creating a website with responsive elements via bootstrap

### Introduction:
This is my initial attempt at creating a robust portfolio utilizing html and CSS. This was also the first introduction to boostrap, which helped ensure that all UI elements are scalable and uniform. This was also the first website that I've linked to multiple html and css files, ensuring that proper hierarchy is utilized. I plan to continue to update this as we progress, gradually adding documents such as my resume and additional coding projects.
